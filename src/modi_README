According to the problems the current version has, I made some modification based on Paul's code. 
Jia 1_13_2020


1. Based on the original idea from Paul, I built a new <modi_cumulative_abundance.sh> function to replace the <cumulative_abundance>. So that it takes an input file as well as an input column. The function then calculate and add another column: cumulative percentage of the given column.
May need to change it to a function instead of .sh file

2. Built a ranking threshold cuttage function

3. Changed <fo_diffs> function to <modi_fo_diffs>, so that it is calculating first order difference for input column instead of abundance

4. Changed the mfpcount to take these changes 
	For now the mfpcount (in this directory and the ones in (/germs/liu2040/MetaFunPrimer/src) are the modified version

5. I am trying to add some <usage> and arguments checking information to the function thresh_tsv. 
	1. In this folder, I changed <thresh_tsv> to <thresh_tsv.sh>. REMEMBER to change it back after testing!!!
	2. I built a test file <test_thre.txt> to test the thresh_tsv.sh, REMEMBER to delete it after testing!!!

6. I am now trying to add some <usage> and arguments checking information to the function <modi_cumulative_abundance> and <fo_diffs> based on what I did to <thresh_tsv>
	1. I changed these two functions to .sh format to test. REMEMBER to change it back after testing!!!
	2. Tested them against <test_thre.txt> and <empty.txt>

TODO: 
Problem: 
1. Shall we use the cumulative percentage for s-score (maybe not, there's negative value for s-score)?

Answer: Yes we will still use cumulative percentage for s-score. But we will change our method to get the s-score: instead of 
standardize, we will use normalization to make all the s-score between 0 to 1


2. We need a new cut-off threshold for this new "cumulative percentage of s-score" (not 80% for cumulative abundance anymore)

Answer: Yes, we will need a new cut-off threshold. (Default 0.8? or user input)

3. Change the <calc_sscore> function to use normalization instead of standardization
