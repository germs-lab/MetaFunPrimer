Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

Q. I have <program> installed and I am able to call it on the command line, but when ``check_reqs.sh`` reports it as missing. :ref:`Answer <A1>`

.. _A1:

A. ``check_reqs.sh`` checks that the program is callable via the output of ``hash <program>``. If you've created an alias for one of the programs, then the ``hash`` function will report that the program isn't callable. If you are certain that calling the program on the command line works, then you can continue running the various ``MetaFunPrimer`` programs. However, it is recommended for this pipeline to remove these aliases.
